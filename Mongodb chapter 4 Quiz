It really is only steps to Sunset Beach and the fruit trees and chickens, coupled with the wonderful evening breezes make this a wonderful natural retreat.  There was plenty of room for us all - and everything was clean and comfortable.  We especially appreciated how kid friendly this property is.  There were kids' dishes in the cupboard and a designated little play area stocked with toys.  Traveling with a two year old can be challenging and Sunset Beach Lodge Retreat made it so easy!  Thank you, Anderson - if you will have us, we will be back."

The kids (three toddlers) esp loved the neat little play area. We really appreciated having the coffee maker, the blender and the washer dryer - they really came in handy. We reported a stuck door lock and Anderson was very prompt to swing by and take care of it.  All in all this was a perfect base for our Oahu trip with three toddlers eager to hit the beaches!! "

The house is spacious, with two bathrooms, which was very nice since I was sharing with 2 men & 2 boys. Its only a few minutes walk to the beach, Ted's bakery and you can lounge in the hammock on the lanai. \nThe downside; my friend and his son were sharing a room which had bedbugs. We called Anderson first thing in the AM and he said he would bring over a new mattress, mattress protector and pillows. He did replace the mattress & pillows. He apologised for the bedbugs, we appreciated that he came out took care of the mattress, but my friend and his son were covered with bites, which put a damper on their trip. They also did not want to sleep in the room again and we had 3 more nights.\nAnother downside was the bottom half of the house was having repairs and the workers shut the water off in the house.  We only found out when we went to take a shower after a day at the beach. They did their best getting the water back on, but it took awhile and we ended up being late for a show in Waikiki. \n\nAnderson and his family were very nice, he even said that we could have our music a little loud because he was working on soundproofing his home, its just with the bedbugs, I feel a discount could have been offered.

Laundry is shared with downstairs unit. BYO laundry powder and pegs.\nAlso not many mozzies ...but we got a few bites and I'd suggest bring personal insect repellent. \nAnother hint: the house is upstairs ...and it's a fairly steep flight of stairs so wouldn't be suitable for people who couldn't manage these \nWe loved this area of the North Shore.  And we thought this airBnb is in an absolutely amazing location! The beautiful golden sand beach just across the road ...and the most amazing breakfasts at Ted's Bakery (2 minute walk). Overall this holiday accommodation far exceeded our expectations"

However, a quick cross of the highway at the driveway and a 3-5 min. walk and you are at Sunset Beach. You cannot see (or hear) the ocean from the house but it is hard to be the location. Ted’s Bakery is just down the highway, about a 4 min. walk as well. We enjoyed numerous meals there and the food is top quality!  Nice to have that so close. We stayed on the top level of the house. It was nice to have a personal bedroom for each of the three of us. We definitely appreciated the space. Amenities are basic but what we needed. Food cannot be left out as the ants will come. There is no A/C. It is best to not be in the house from say noon till sundown as it will be quite hot. However, opening the windows and bringing in the evening air is sufficient (we stayed the first week of November.) The occasional rain showers also helped to mediate the heat inside. Roosters begin their morning chatter around 4:30 am. Earplugs are a must if you are used to a more quiet sleeping environment. We had a few leaks in the roof on a day when the rains were heavier. We just moved the sofa out of the drip line and all was fine. We drove a lot around the island and this home was a great starting place for our day trips. Would definitely recommend this home for a stay in the North Shore."

Don’t know if it’s people being careless with drinks or what, but nothing a slip cover couldn’t fix. We think the residence is on septic because there are signs in the bathrooms asking not to flush toilet paper, which seemed odd. I’m used to this in 3rd world countries, but not Hawaii. At first I chalked it up to the house being on the North Shore, but then we had guests over that are locals and they even commented on the signs and found it strange. \n\nThis is on the top floor of a house and I think the bottom floor is also an AirBnB along with another home on the property.  The first night the guests downstairs, some young men, were being very loud. I wasn’t sure if they were the permanent residents so I didn’t complain to the host. \n\nLastly, even though the house is setback from the road, since you have to leave the windows open for ventilation you will hear cars driving by all night. \n\nBUT the house is a 5 minute walk from Sunset Beach. There is a Foodland 2.3 miles away and Ted’s Bakery is about 100 yards away. It’s a GREAT location! And again it’s very roomy!!"
